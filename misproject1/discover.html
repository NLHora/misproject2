        <h2>Why I chose UMD</h2>
        <p>I chose to go to the University of Minnesota Duluth for numerous reasons. First, I have always enjoyed visiting Duluth with my family, and the city’s size is perfect for me, there are plenty of hikes and places to explore in the area but also many things to do in town. Another major factor was the business school, which aligns well with my academic and career goals. Lastly, I was drawn to the campus, it offers a comfortable environment with high quality dining and housing options.</p>
		<h2>About UMD</h2>
