		<h2>Skiing</h2>
		<p>I’ve been skiing my entire life, and in high school I made the decision to join my school’s alpine ski team, one of the best decisions I have ever made. Over my three years on the team, I not only refined my skiing, but I also developed skills in leadership, confidence, and collaboration. During my senior year, I had the honor of becoming a captain, which involved motivating others, leading drills and stretching, organizing events, and many other duties. Additionally, balancing school and ski taught me more about time management with my academics. I am looking forward to skiing for the Duluth alpine ski team while continuing to grow as a person and skier.</p>
        <h2>Hiking and Camping</h2>
        <p>Hiking has been an important part of my life, as my family often takes trips around the country to explore national parks and experience beautiful nature. This past summer, however, I had the opportunity to take a camping trip to Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons with a few friends. The trip was extremely challenging and memorable, it taught me lots about planning, independence, and problem-solving. The most memorable part of the experience was hiking to Delta Lake, a strenuous eight-mile round trip hike with over 2,000 feet of elevation gain. It was the most difficult hike I have ever completed, yet the most rewarding. Reaching the top after many hours was a feeling I will never forget and hope to experience again as I hike more in the future.</p>
